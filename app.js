//## Easy Going
//1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

//let i = 1;
//for (let i = 1; i< 21; i++)[
    //console.log([i])

 //## Get Even
//1. Write a `for` loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.
   //>Hint: Think about the increment expression.
   //let i = 0;
   //for (i = 0; i < 200; i++) { 
     //  if (i % 2 === 0) {
       //    console.log(i);
       //}
   //}
  // ## Excited Kitten
//1. Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times.
//let sentence = "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!"
//for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
//console.log("Love me, pet me! HSSSSS!");
    //}

    // I'm not sure if this worked effectively. The line in the console had a 20 next to let but it didnt log 20 times. I wasn't sure if this stands for 2 times?
//2. For every **even** number in your loop, log "...human...why you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...", or "...why does the red dot always get away..." at random.
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0)
   {console.log(math.random() , "...human...why you taking pictures of me?..." || "...the catnip made me do it..." || "...why does the red dot always get away..." );
    }
}
//I wasn't sure what to do but this was my best guess.
