//1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

//1. easy going 

for (let i =0; i < 21; i++){
}

//2.Excited Kitten
for (let i = 0 ; i<20 ; i++){
    console.log("Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!");
    
  //index 0, which is even, is actually instance #1, which is odd. This is in addition to the previous console log.
    if (i%2 == 1 ){
      let response = ["...human...why you taking pictures of me?...","...the catnip made me do it...","...why does the red dot always get away..."];
      console.log(response[Math.floor(Math.random()*3)]);
