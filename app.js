//## Easy Going
//1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

//let i = 1;
//for (let i = 1; i< 21; i++)[
    //console.log([i])

 //## Get Even
//1. Write a `for` loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.
   //>Hint: Think about the increment expression.
   let i = 0;
   for (i = 0; i < 200; i++) { 
       if (i % 2 === 0) {
           console.log(i);
       }
   }
